# Sign-Language-Detection-System
A real time Sign Language detection system , for the cause of helping deaf and dumb people communicate with normal people and each other in a comfortable and easy manner in their day to day life.


Introduction
This project is a Real Time Sign Language Detection System made primarily for the Dumb and Deaf People. It is designed to recognize signs and gestures using a computer vision algorithm that analyzes live video feeds from a camera.


Technology

The project is built using the following technologies:
Python
OpenCV
Tensorflow
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Mediapipe Holistic Pointer-based Mapping
How it Works
The sign language detection system uses mediapipe mapping to predict the correct meaning of a provided sign under different circumstances. Unlike other techniques such as edge detection, the mediapipe pointer map system maps the distance between the pointers of the face, hands, and eyes to determine the correct interpretation of the sign. The system is designed to take into account the ambiguous nature of sign language, which can be subject to variations in interpretation.


Installation
To install the system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Install the required packages and libraries mentioned in the main code file
Run the system
Usage
To use the system, follow these steps:


Run the system
Position yourself in front of the camera
Start signing with your hands
The system will detect and interpret your signs in real time


Future Work
This project is a work in progress, and there are several improvements that could be made in the future. Some areas for improvement include:

Currently the system is able to recognise very fewer signs , it requires more computational power in order to be trained for further signs.
Improving the accuracy of the sign detection algorithm
Expanding the system to support additional sign languages
Integrating the system with other assistive technologies
